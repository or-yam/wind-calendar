# Wind Calendar

Generate calendar feeds for windsurfing and kitesurfing sessions based on wind forecasts.

## What This Skill Does

This skill provides access to an API that generates calendar feeds (ICS format) for windsurfing and kitesurfing sessions. The API:

- Fetches wind forecasts from Open-Meteo (primary) or Windguru (fallback) for Israeli Mediterranean coast locations
- Uses public weather model data (GFS, ICON, GDPS, IFS-HRES) from NOAA, DWD, CMC, and ECMWF
- Filters sessions based on customizable wind speed, wave height, and duration thresholds
- Groups consecutive hours of good conditions into sessions
- Returns standard ICS calendar format compatible with all calendar applications
- Auto-updates every 6 hours with fresh forecast data

The calendar feeds can be subscribed to in Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook, or any other calendar app that supports ICS subscriptions.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- User asks to **see/show/display** wind forecasts ("show me wind", "what's the forecast", "tell me the forecast")
- User asks about upcoming good wind conditions ("when is good wind", "any good wind days")
- User wants to add wind forecasts to their calendar or subscribe
- User mentions windsurfing, kitesurfing, or wind sports activities
- User asks about wind conditions at specific Israeli beach locations

## Default Behavior: Fetch First, Then Offer Subscription

**When users ask to see/show the forecast:**

1. **Immediately fetch** the ICS data from the API endpoint
2. **Parse and display** upcoming wind sessions in readable format:
   - Date and time range (convert UTC to local or show as-is)
   - Wind speed range, direction, wave height (from SUMMARY field)
   - Hourly breakdown (from DESCRIPTION field)
3. **Then recommend** subscribing for automatic updates with platform-specific instructions

**When users explicitly ask to subscribe or add to calendar:**

Skip the fetch and go straight to subscription instructions.

**ICS Format Overview:**

- Each wind session is a VEVENT block
- SUMMARY: "Wind 13-14kn N | 0.7m waves"
- DTSTART/DTEND: UTC timestamps
- DESCRIPTION: Hourly conditions (newline-separated)

## Available Locations

The API currently supports these Israeli Mediterranean coast locations:

- `beit-yanai` - Mediterranean coast, north of Netanya
- `herzliya` - Popular Tel Aviv area spot
- `tel-aviv` - Central location, urban beach
- `bat-galim` - Haifa area spot

## API Endpoint

```
https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar
```

## Query Parameters

### Required

- `location` - One of: `beit-yanai`, `herzliya`, `tel-aviv`, `bat-galim`

### Optional

- `windMin` - Minimum wind speed in knots (default: 14)
- `windMax` - Maximum wind speed in knots (default: 35)
- `minSessionHours` - Minimum session duration in hours (default: 2)
- `waveHeightMin` - Minimum wave height in meters (default: 0.4)
- `model` - Forecast model ID (default: `om_gfs`)
  - **Open-Meteo (Recommended)**:
    - `om_gfs` - GFS 13km (NOAA Global Forecast System - default)
    - `om_icon` - ICON 13km (DWD German weather model)
    - `om_gdps` - GDPS 15km (Canadian Meteorological Centre)
    - `om_ifs` - IFS-HRES 9km (ECMWF high-resolution)
  - **Windguru (Legacy, for backward compatibility)**:
    - `3` - GFS 13km
    - `45` - ICON 13km
    - `59` - GDPS 15km
    - `117` - IFS-HRES 9km

### Parameter Constraints

- `windMin` must be >= 0
- `windMax` must be <= 200
- `windMin` must be < `windMax`
- `minSessionHours` must be between 0 and 24

## Example URL Construction

### Basic Usage

```
https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=herzliya
```

This uses default thresholds: 14-35kn wind, 2+ hour sessions, 0.4m+ waves.

### Customized for Stronger Winds

```
https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=beit-yanai&windMin=18&windMax=30&minSessionHours=3
```

This filters for stronger, longer sessions.

### Using Alternative Forecast Model

```
https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=herzliya&model=om_ifs
```

This uses the ECMWF IFS-HRES 9km model (often considered most accurate). If Open-Meteo fails, the API automatically falls back to the equivalent Windguru model.

### Beginner-Friendly Settings

```
https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=tel-aviv&windMin=10&windMax=20&minSessionHours=1
```

This shows lighter wind sessions suitable for beginners.

## Response Format

The API returns:

- **Content-Type**: `text/calendar; charset=utf-8`
- **Format**: Standard ICS (RFC 5545)
- **Cache-Control**: 6-hour caching with stale-while-revalidate

Each calendar event represents a wind session with:

- **Summary**: "Wind 14-22kn NW | 0.8m waves"
- **Start/End Time**: In local timezone (Asia/Jerusalem)
- **Description**: Hourly breakdown of conditions (wind speed, gusts, direction)

Example event:

```
SUMMARY: Wind 14-22kn NW | 0.8m waves
DTSTART: 20260305T100000Z
DTEND: 20260305T160000Z
DESCRIPTION: 12:00  14kn  gusts 16kn  NW
             14:00  18kn  gusts 22kn  NW
             16:00  16kn  gusts 19kn  NW
```

## How to Subscribe to the Calendar

Guide users through platform-specific subscription methods:

### Apple Calendar (macOS/iOS)

1. Copy the API URL (starting with `https://`)
2. Replace `https://` with `webcal://`
3. Open the `webcal://` URL in Safari
4. Calendar app will open and prompt to subscribe

**Example:**

```
webcal://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=herzliya
```

**Sync Frequency**: Apple Calendar typically syncs subscribed calendars every ~15 minutes.

### Google Calendar

1. Open Google Calendar in a web browser
2. Click the "+" next to "Other calendars"
3. Select "From URL"
4. Paste the `https://` URL (NOT `webcal://`)
5. Click "Add calendar"

**Important**: Google Calendar syncs subscribed calendars slowly (every 12-24 hours). This cannot be changed by the user.

### Outlook

1. In Outlook, go to File → Account Settings → Internet Calendars
2. Click "New"
3. Paste the `https://` URL
4. Click OK

**Sync Frequency**: Outlook typically syncs subscribed calendars every ~12 hours.

### Direct Download

Users can also download a one-time snapshot:

1. Open the URL in any web browser
2. The browser will download a `.ics` file
3. Double-click to import into any calendar app

Note: Downloaded files don't auto-update. Subscriptions are recommended for ongoing forecasts.

## What Sessions Look Like

Wind sessions are filtered and grouped based on the specified parameters. Each session includes:

- **Title**: Summarizes wind range, dominant direction, and average wave height
- **Time Range**: Start and end times in Asia/Jerusalem timezone
- **Detailed Conditions**: Hourly breakdown in the event description
- **Daylight Only**: Sessions are filtered to daylight hours based on sunrise/sunset times

Sessions are created by:

1. Filtering forecast hours by wind speed, wave height thresholds
2. Grouping consecutive hours (within 3-hour gaps)
3. Keeping only groups that meet the minimum duration requirement

## Update Frequency

- **Forecast Data**: Updated every 6 hours from Windguru
- **API Cache**: Responses cached for 6 hours
- **Calendar Sync**: Depends on the calendar application (see platform sections above)

When the forecast updates, subscribed calendars will automatically receive the new data on their next sync cycle.

## Important Limitations

- **Forecast Accuracy**: Forecasts use public weather model data (GFS, ICON, GDPS, IFS-HRES) and are subject to typical weather prediction limitations. Different models can show different predictions - no model is always correct.
- **Data Source**: Primary provider is Open-Meteo. If Open-Meteo fails, the API automatically falls back to Windguru for the equivalent model.
- **Geographic Coverage**: Currently limited to Israeli Mediterranean coast locations
- **Daylight Hours Only**: Sessions are filtered to occur during daylight (based on sunrise/sunset)
- **Timezone**: All times are in Asia/Jerusalem timezone
- **Sync Delays**: Calendar app sync frequencies vary (Google Calendar is the slowest)

## Example Agent Workflows

### Workflow 1: Display Current Forecast

**User**: "Show me wind forecast in Beit Yanai" / "When is good wind at Herzliya this week?"

**Agent Actions**:

1. Construct URL: `https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=beit-yanai`
2. **Fetch the ICS data** using curl/HTTP/WebFetch
3. **Parse and display** upcoming sessions in readable format:

```
Upcoming wind sessions for Beit Yanai:

1. March 12, 2026 — 08:00–20:00 (Asia/Jerusalem)
   Wind: 14–25kn NE | Waves: 1.4m
   • 08:00 — 24.9kn (gusts 26.6kn) E
   • 11:00 — 16.7kn (gusts 16.5kn) NE
   • 14:00 — 14kn (gusts 13.6kn) NE
   • 17:00 — 15kn (gusts 16.4kn) N

   • 14:00 — 14.6kn (gusts 10.9kn) NW
   • 17:00 — 15.6kn (gusts 16kn) N
```

4. **Recommend subscription**: "Want me to add this to your calendar so it updates automatically?"

### Workflow 2: Calendar Subscription

**User**: "Add windsurfing forecasts for Herzliya to my calendar"

**Agent Actions**:

1. Construct URL: `https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=herzliya`
2. Detect user's platform (if possible) or provide all options
3. For Apple users, provide webcal URL: `webcal://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=herzliya`
4. For Google/Outlook users, provide https:// URL with platform-specific instructions (see sections below)
5. Explain: "This calendar will update automatically every 6 hours with fresh forecasts (14-35kn winds, 2+ hour sessions)"

### Workflow 3: Kitesurfing-Specific Requirements

**User**: "I want kite forecasts for Tel Aviv but only strong wind days, at least 3 hours long"

**Agent Actions**:

1. Construct URL for longer, stronger sessions: `https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=tel-aviv&windMin=20&windMax=35&minSessionHours=3`
2. Provide subscription instructions
3. Explain: "This filters for sustained strong wind sessions (20-35 knots, 3+ hours) ideal for kitesurfing"

### Workflow 4: Beginner Windsurfer

**User**: "I'm learning to windsurf in Herzliya, what days will have light winds?"

**Agent Actions**:

1. Construct URL for lighter winds: `https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=herzliya&windMin=8&windMax=15&minSessionHours=1`
2. Provide subscription instructions
3. Explain: "This shows gentler wind sessions (8-15 knots) perfect for learning"

### Workflow 5: Comparing Multiple Spots

**User**: "Which spot has better wind this weekend - Herzliya or Beit Yanai?"

**Agent Actions**:

1. Generate URLs for both locations
2. Suggest subscribing to both calendars with different names/colors
3. Or: Offer to fetch both ICS files and compare upcoming sessions
4. Explain: "You can subscribe to both and see them side-by-side in your calendar"

### Workflow 6: Comparing Different Models

**User**: "Show me what ECMWF says about the wind this week versus GFS"

**Agent Actions**:

1. Fetch ICS for same location with model=om_ifs (ECMWF): `https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=herzliya&model=om_ifs`
2. Fetch ICS for same location with model=om_gfs (GFS): `https://wind-calendar.vercel.app/api/calendar?location=herzliya&model=om_gfs`
3. Parse and compare the sessions from both models
4. Display differences: "ECMWF predicts wind on March 12-13, while GFS shows March 13-14"
5. Explain: "Different models can show different forecasts. ECMWF (IFS-HRES) is often considered most accurate for short-term forecasts."

## Troubleshooting

### No Sessions Appearing

If a subscribed calendar shows no events:

- Wind conditions may not meet the threshold criteria
- Try lowering `windMin` or `minSessionHours` parameters
- Check that the location name is spelled correctly (exact match required)

### Calendar Not Updating

If forecasts seem stale:

- Check the calendar app's sync settings
- Google Calendar has the longest delay (12-24 hours)
- Try manually refreshing the calendar in the app
- For Apple Calendar, force refresh by removing and re-adding the subscription

### Invalid Location Error

Location names must exactly match (case-sensitive):

- `beit-yanai` (not "beit yanai" or "Beit-Yanai")
- `herzliya` (not "Herzliya")
- `tel-aviv` (not "tel aviv" or "Tel-Aviv")
- `bat-galim` (not "bat galim")

### Parameter Errors

If the API returns an error about invalid parameters:

- Ensure `windMin` < `windMax`
- Check that `windMin` >= 0 and `windMax` <= 200
- Verify `minSessionHours` is between 0 and 24
- All numeric parameters must be valid numbers
